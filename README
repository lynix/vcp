SUMMARY
--------------------------

'vcp' is intended to be a (limited) replacement for 'cp' or 'mv', providing some
additional features like visual progress information and error handling.



USAGE
--------------------------

'vcp' is designed to be called similar to 'cp'/'mv':

    $ vcp /foo/file1 /bar/directory2 /path/to/destination

Note: in contrast to standard 'cp', you don't need to supply '-r' for copying
directories. 

For a complete list of switches and options please see the help text (`vcp -h`).



FEATURES
--------------------------

Advantages compared to 'cp' (the cool stuff):

    * Progress Information:     Progress bars or textual information like
                                transfer percentage, speed and ETA.
    
    * Error Handling:           A failed file will not interrupt the whole
                                process, it will be skipped and reported at the
                                end.
                                
    * Smart Argument Parsing:   No need to think of recursion ('cp -r'), folders
                                will automatically be copied together with their
                                contents.

    * Crawling:                 All source items are crawled *before* transfer
                                is started, allowing user prompt for overwriting
                                or skipping.
                                (no coming back after two hours and seeing a
                                dumb overwriting confirmation prompt which
                                caused the whole transfer to stop just a few
                                seconds after you left the room... ;) )



HISTORY / PHILOSOPHY
--------------------------

Back in 2009, after switching from Gentoo to Arch I started missing progress
information for cp/mv, which Gentoo had provided via a patch for coreutils. As I
used to copy large files around on a very weak PIII box, this annoyed me so hard
that I decided to write a simple replacement.

'vcp' was my very first piece of C code, and one can see this at some lines;)
I'll try to give this ancient project some new love in form of code style
improvements and proper abstraction if I find some time.

The goal of 'vcp' is NOT to provide a full replacement for 'cp'/'mv'. It shall
only be a simple tool for common file transfer operations, providing the
aforementioned additional features.
