2009-09-29	- Added CHANGELOG to provide more detailed information than
			  the git-commit-summaries
			  
			- Switched data structure for file lists from double linked
			  lists to array-based ones.
			  This was done because of the much simpler code compared to
			  all that pointer stuff in the version with linked lists. I
			  think this change does not mean any disadvantage in memory
			  consumption because only the pointers to the items need to
			  be stored and therefore the array itself should not get a
			  significant size.
